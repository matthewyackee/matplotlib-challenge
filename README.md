Module 5 Challenge for UofD Data Analysis bootcamp

The file is pymaceuticals.ipynb and is located in the directory labeled (Pymaceuticals).

I used the format provided by the (pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb) file.

I also utilized the website (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html), (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index.html), and (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html#scipy-api)https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html#scipy-api for assistance in determining what operations to use in my code.
